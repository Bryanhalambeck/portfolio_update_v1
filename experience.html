        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have been a web designer for almost for 8 years. My first and only job was at Techno Studios. I worked at TS from April 2006 to March 2014, but in 2014 Techno Studios went out of business. My role at Techno was mainly front end devolpment, rarely I dabbled with some back end devolpment.</p>

        <p>Jerry Samson was my former boss at TS from 2006 through 2014. Here is what he had to say about my preformance over the years. <q>Bryan was an excellent front end web devolper. You could always count on him to get the job done on time and for it to be done well. I think only once in 8 years he missed the deadline for a project. He was also a great person. Always putting others first and putting smiles on others faces. He always motivated and lifted others up to do their best.</q> </p>
